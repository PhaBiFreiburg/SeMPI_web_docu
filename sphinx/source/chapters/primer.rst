Introduction
============

SeMPI 2 provides a prediction pipeline for PKS (type I) and NRPS biosynthetic gene cluster (BCG) products. The products are subsequently screened in public available natural product databases. The user can modify the product scaffold before submission to the screening algorithm.

We try to make SeMPI as user friendly as possible for such a complex pipeline. Therefore, we assign components which are not absolutely self-explanatory with an  question mark. If you think some components are not clearly explained or need more information, please contact us and we will take care for it.
