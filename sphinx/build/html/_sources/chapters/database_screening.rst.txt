Database screening
##################

SeMPI allows to screen publicly available natural compound databases (DBs). 
The query can be the predicted scaffolds of a cluster, a user defined modification of 
scaffolds or a totally user defined set of molecules.

The DB screening is not limited to one scaffold. As SeMPI can predict multiple scaffolds for one cluster (where the order of continues blocks can not be derived), so that the screening allow to submit multiple scaffolds for 
a query.

Additionally to the pre-computed DBs, the user can upload custom defined DBs in SDF or SMILES format.

The database screening can also be performed for user defined molecules and molecule sets, 
entirely without preliminarily prediction.
Just follow the "scaffold upload" button
`Scaffold upload <http://132.230.102.133/scaffold_upload>`_
and submit any molecule query to the screening algorithm.

Use cases
=========

The database (DB) screening allows users: 

(1) to estimate the novelty of their gene clusters (a scaffold which does not match similar scaffolds in known databases, is very likely a novel cluster)
(2) the identification of possible post-modifications, which cannot be detected by prediction algorithms yet
(3) the identification of similar clusters (based on the product) 
(4) the matching of custom defined molecules in a genome (using the scaffold upload tool)

   Flow chart of the DB screening pipeline.

The database screening uses a two step approach to identify similar compounds from public DBs (see :numref:`db-screen`). First, a pre-selection of possible matches are identified using Morgan fingerprints (see :ref:`fp_screen`). Second, the pre-selection is ranked using a Maximum Common Substructure Approach (see :ref:`mcs_rank`). The scaffolds can be modified before submission (see :ref:`scaffold_mod`).

.. _scaffold_mod:

Scaffold modification
=====================

   The predicted scaffolds can be modified before submission to the database screening, using the scaffold input button.

   The JSME editor allows all kinds of modifications of the predicted scaffold.

   Additional building blocks or post-modifications can be added to the original prediction.

The scaffold modification can be performed using the `JSME Molecule Editor <https://peter-ertl.com/jsme/2013_03/help.html>`_, a very powerful editor, which allows to add new molecules and modify the 
original prediction.

.. _custom_db:

Custom DB input format
======================

The custom DB choice allows to upload a file with user defined target molecules which can be screened additionally to the default DB choices. It is also possible to screen only a user defined DB, just untick
all the default DB choices before submission.

The format for the custom DB must be either SDF or SMILES format.
Examples of both input types can be downloaded from the `Scaffold upload <http://132.230.102.133/scaffold_upload>`_ page. 

.. _fp_screen:

Fingerprint screening
=====================

The selected DBs are screened using molecular fingerprints (FP). For the screening the rdkit implementation
of Morgan FPs (Circular FPs) were chosen (`Morgan Fingerprints <https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html#fingerprinting-and-molecular-similarity>`_).
Specifically a Morgan FB with radius 3 and features is implemented.

In many cases the scaffolds of PKs and NRPs contain the same building blocks multiple times. 
This property can not 
be accurately represented by bit fingerprints. Multiple identical building blocks set the same bits (and
bits are only set ones), which leads to similar fingerprints for scaffolds with different amounts of identical building blocks. 
Therefore, the FPs are implemented as count vectors, which distinguish molecules also based on the amount of present
bits. 

For count vectors the similarity metric is calculated using dice similarity instead of Tanimoto coefficient.

If multiple scaffolds are submitted a joint FP is computed for all scaffolds.
This allows SeMPI to match correct scaffolds also of clusters where only fragments could be predicted. 

The FP screening only creates a pre-selection of possible scaffold matches (default 50).

.. _mcs_rank:

Maximum Common Substructure Ranking
===================================

Even though the FP screening collects very close matches to the predicted scaffolds, 
some properties cannot be matches accurately with FPs.

For example: The order of building blocks cannot be accurately represented even by count vectors.

Therefore an ranking is applied to the pre-selected molecules. 

The maximum common substructure (MCS) algorithm ranks the pre-selection based on the 
best MCS score for each scaffold fragment with the target 
molecules.
