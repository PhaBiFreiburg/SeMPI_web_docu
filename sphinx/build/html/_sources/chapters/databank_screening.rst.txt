Database screening
###################

The database screening allows users: 
(1) to estimate the novelty of their gene clusters (a scaffold which does not match similar 
scaffolds in known databases)
(2) the identification of possible post-modifications, which cannot be detected by prediction algorithms yet
(3) the identification of similar clusters (based on the product) 
(4) the matching of custom defined molecules in a genome (using the scaffold upload tool)
