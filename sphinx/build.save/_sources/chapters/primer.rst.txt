Introduction
============

SeMPI 2 provides a prediction pipeline for PKS (type I) and NRPS biosynthetic gene cluster (BCG) products. The products are subsequently screened in public available natural product databases. The user can modify the product scaffold before submission to the screening algorithm.

.. Detailed information about both cluster types can be found here:

We try to make SeMPI as user friendly as possible for such a complex pipeline. Therefore, we assign components which are not absolutely self-explanatory with an  question mark. Which upon hovering, displays additional information.
